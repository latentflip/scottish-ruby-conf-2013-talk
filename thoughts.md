# What _I_ love about writing JavaScript apps

# Lessons

# State of play

# Server vs client

# Future


- Full control on the server, less control on the client
- In the dark ages
  - slow, buggy

- Lots of changes in the web since 2000 and now

- Backlash against heavy frameworks
- Browsers are really good at HTML
- HTML is good for building documents/applications

- Looking at the whole ecosystem from:
  - bad browsers from 2005
  - people trying to abstract away HTML (sproutcore)

- As of today:
  - IE is competing
  - Browsers are very, very different from 2005
  - Locus of innovation moved from server to client
    - Lots of new stuff of client
    - Lots of people working hard to take advantage

- People are demanding faster performance, better interactions
- Backends don't go away, still a lot of stuff going on
  - (How much of your app actually generates HTML)
- You're going to have to generate a lot of JavaScript
  - Basecamp 960kb

- How should we think about the JavaScript we are writing
  - Craft: Ruby is a craft, we are constantly honing, always improving the state of the art
  - JavaScript: necessary evil
    - This is where a "sprinkle" of JavaScript
    - What happens when you think about 1MB of JS as sprinkles
    - You can avoid honing your skills
  
- The situation as it stands
  - Still very early
  - I hate this
  - 2012: The year rubyists wrote off JS libs
  - Stop hiding from JS

- Things are better than they were two years ago
- But still a long way ago

# So why use JS instead of just sticking to rails

- We are going to have to write lots of JS anyway
- Let's do it properly

# This is not a direct replacement for what you are doing


# Stop hiding from JS
- you're going to have to do it anyway
